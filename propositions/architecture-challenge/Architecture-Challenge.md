# Architecture Challenge Workshop

---

# Overview

Before we start on any architecture work we need to know what business challenge we aim to address and that we can add value as enterprise architects

At the end of this workshop, we should have​

- Identified the problem​ or opportunity
- Gained an understanding what successful resolution looks like​
- Established there is a potential route to success
- Identified the key stakeholders who must commit to delivering success​
- Determined if there is potential enterprise architecture work to carry out

# Workshop Set Up

2. Attendees
3. Invitation
4. Workshop [Roles and Rules](https://github.com/Open-Archypelago/Archypelago/tree/main/building-blocks/Roles-Rules)

# Precondition

A concern of potentially enterprise wide significance has been identified by an EA​

e.g.​

- A formal request for architecture work is made
- A senior stakeholder says "take a look at this..."​
- An EA gets an idea at a conference​
- An EA hears a worrying statement about...​
  - a project​
  - technical debt​
  - lack of collaboration​
  - siloes​
- An experienced EA just gets a sense that something is wrong!​

---

# Workshop formats

There are three formats that we use

- Informal with EAs only​ (these can be quite quick)
- More formal with key stakeholders and EAs​
- Multiple stakeholder meetings followed by a joint playback​

- the workshop may be held as one intensive session or a series of shorter sessions over several days
- the facilitator should consider giving the participants breaks after each section

---

# Attendees

You can combine formats if it helps​

- You want a rehearsal with EAs only​
- You want to make sense of what the stakeholders said (e.g. create the stakeholder playback)​

5 to 8 people is an ideal size for the meeting​

Give attendees plenty of notice of the meeting

Meetings can be fully remote​

# Architecture Challenge Proposition

Workshop structure and template for producing an effective enterprise architecture problem statement

## Description

The process for setting up the workshop is described including the key [Roles and Rules](https://github.com/Open-Archypelago/Archypelago/tree/main/building-blocks/Roles-Rules)

The steps in the workshop are

- define the [problem to be addressed](https://github.com/Open-Archypelago/Archypelago/tree/main/building-blocks/problem-statement)
- define [what success looks like](https://github.com/Open-Archypelago/Archypelago/tree/main/building-blocks/what-good-looks-like)
- outline a [route to achieve success](https://github.com/Open-Archypelago/Archypelago/tree/main/building-blocks/route-to-success)
- identify [key stakeholders](https://github.com/Open-Archypelago/Archypelago/tree/main/building-blocks/stakeholders)
- go / no go decision
- the [role of enterprise architects](https://github.com/Open-Archypelago/Archypelago/tree/main/building-blocks/Architect-Value)

At the end of the workshop, there should be

- an agreed well formed problem statement
- a description of what success looks like
- a decision on whether to prioritise architecture activity
- an owner to communicate the outcome and take it forward

# Strategic Opportunity Identification Workshop

---

# Overview
This workshop examines the value chains that an organisation executes and identifies areas where major improvements can be made. These value chains may span the whole organisation or be limited to a subset.

At the end of this workshop, we should have​

- a well defined scope of the area investigated
- a description of the major issues in the area being considered
- a description of business impact of these issues
- a recommendation to focus on a limited number of pain points

# Precondition

There is a need to identify concerns of potentially enterprise wide significance within a defined area of the organisation

e.g.​

- A formal request for architecture work is made
- A senior stakeholder says "take a look at this..."​
- An EA gets an idea at a conference​
- An EA hears a worrying statement about...​
  - a project​
  - technical debt​
  - lack of collaboration​
  - siloes​
- An experienced EA just gets a sense that something is wrong!​

---

# Workshop formats

There are three formats that we use

- Informal with EAs only​ (these can be quite quick)
- More formal with key stakeholders and EAs​
- Multiple stakeholder meetings followed by a joint playback​

- the workshop may be held as one intensive session if the scope is small and participants are fully committed
- however, 2 to 5 days may be a more realistic timeline for many participants
- the facilitator should consider giving the participants breaks after each section

---

# Attendees

You can combine formats if it helps​

- You want a rehearsal with EAs only​
- You want to make sense of what the stakeholders said (e.g. create the stakeholder playback)​

5 to 8 people is an ideal size for the meeting​

Give attendees plenty of notice of the meeting

Meetings can be fully remote​

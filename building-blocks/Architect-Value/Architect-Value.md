# When do Enterprise Architects add value?

Enterprise architects (EAs) add value by

- making sense of complexity
- showing how to navigate complexity
- guide the reduction in unnecessary complexity
- helping to manage uncertainty

EAs help organisations address messy and wicked problems that have strategic impacts

---

# Messy Problems

- have high process, data or technology complexity
- problem space is reasonably stable or changes in a predictable way
- target state scenarios can be defined with reasonably sound assumptions

# Wicked Problems

- are poorly understood, are ambiguous
- have a constantly changing problem space with complex interdependencies
- often have significant social / people / political complexityâ€‹
- large parts of the currrent and / or target state cannot be defined with confidence

# Or A mix of both

---

# Messy Problems

- Enterprise Architects can help
    - make sense of the complexity
    - define target state scenarios
    - define roadmaps to guide the delivery of a target
    - define an incremental approach to benefits delivery

EA engagement is likely to be front loaded focused on defining current state, target state and the roadmap followed by a supporting role to help maintain the overall integrity of the approach as the business and technology changes progress

# Wicked Problems

- Enterprise Architects can help
    - make sense of the complexity
    - identify areas of uncertainty
    - define experiments and nudges to enable learning
    - define an incremental approach to benefits delivery

EA engagement is likely to be continual during the programme which will be based on an agile learning approach

# A Problem with both Wicked and Messy Parts

- Identify components of the problem space that are Messy and those that are Wicked
- Design the enterprise architecture response to suit each part of the problem space

# When do Enterprise Architects add value?

Enterprise architects (EAs) add value by

- making sense of complexity
- showing how to navigate complexity
- guide the reduction in unnecessary complexity
- helping to manage uncertainty

EAs help organisations address messy and wicked problems that have strategic impacts

---

# Messy Problems

- have high process, data or technology complexity
- problem space is reasonably stable or changes in a predictable way
- target state scenarios can be defined with reasonably sound assumptions

# Wicked Problems

- are poorly understood, are ambiguous
- have a constantly changing problem space with complex interdependencies
- often have significant social / people / political complexityâ€‹
- large parts of the currrent and / or target state cannot be defined with confidence

# Tame Problems

- Problems that are neither messy or wicked

---

# Analyse the Problem Space

- Break down the problem space into compoennts that are:
    - Messy
    - Wicked
    - Simple
- Design the enterprise architecture response to suit each part of the problem space

---

# Messy Problems

- Enterprise Architects can help
    - make sense of the complexity
    - define target state scenarios
    - define roadmaps to guide the delivery of a target
    - define an incremental approach to benefits delivery

EA engagement is likely to be front loaded focused on defining current state, target state and the roadmap followed by a supporting role to help maintain the overall integrity of the approach as the business and technology changes progress

---

# Wicked Problems

- Enterprise Architects can help
    - make sense of the complexity
    - identify areas of uncertainty
    - define experiments and nudges to enable learning
    - define an incremental approach to benefits delivery

EA engagement is likely to be continual during the programme which will be based on an agile learning approach

---

# Tame Problems

- These should be left to the execution team to deliver with minimal involvement from enterprise architects
- Intervention may be required where
   - standard do not exist
   - the organisation lacks expertise in how to apply the standards
- Where interventions are required the aim should be to help the execution become self sufficient as quickly as possible

---

# Do Enterprise Architects have a Role?

- Is this a tame, messy or wicked problem?
- What value will enterprise architects bring to the challenge?
- Does this challenge align with enterprise architecture priorities?
- Is there sufficient availability of enterprise architects to support this challenge?

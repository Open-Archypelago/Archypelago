# Roles
The workshop will require these roles to be successful -

- Facilitator - takes the attendees through the workshop structure, adapting it as necessary, owns the schedule
- Challenge owner - presents the challenge that teh workshop is addressing, makes decisions when asked to do so by the Facilitator, maybe a proxy for a key stakeholder
- Scribe - makes notes when asked to do so by the Facilitator
- Timekeeper - keeps time when asked to do so by the Facilitator
- Experts - the Facilitator should think about what knowledge is necessary to conclude the workshop successfully. Do "experts" need to be present for some or all sessions? Can they be engaged in advance and provide workshop materials for use in the sessions or as pre-read materials?

# Ground rules

1. The Facilitator is in charge
2. Challenge owner makes decisions
3. No distractions from phones or emails or chat
    - switch off notifications
    - we will have breaks so you can pick up important items
    - try to schedule a work crisis for another time!
1. However, don't worry about children, pets, partners, deliveries, builders, etc
    - they will interrupt and distract, it is OK!
    - this is normal!
    - sometimes they help with the creativity...
1. If you need a break, just say so (we may all need one too!)

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Before we start on any architecture work we need to know what
business problem aim to solve​ and that we can add value as enterprise
architects</p>
<p>At the end of this workshop, we should have​</p>
<ul>
<li>Identified the problem​</li>
<li>Gained an understanding what successful resolution looks like​</li>
<li>Established there is a potential route to success</li>
<li>Identified the key stakeholders who must commit to delivering
success​</li>
<li>Determined if there is potential enterprise architecture work to
carry out</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="when-do-enterprise-architects-add-value"
class="slide section level1">
<h1>When do Enterprise Architects add value?</h1>
<p>Enterprise architects (EAs) add value by</p>
<ul>
<li>making sense of complexity</li>
<li>showing how to navigate complexity</li>
<li>guide the reduction in unnecessary complexity</li>
<li>helping to manage uncertainty</li>
</ul>
<p>EAs help organisations address messy and wicked problems that have
strategic impacts</p>
</div>
<div id="messy-problems" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Messy Problems</h1>
<ul>
<li>have high process, data or technology complexity</li>
<li>problem space is reasonably stable or changes in a predictable
way</li>
<li>target state scenarios can be defined with reasonably sound
assumptions</li>
<li>Enterprise Architects can help
<ul>
<li>make sense of the complexity</li>
<li>define target state scenarios</li>
<li>define roadmaps to guide the delivery of a target</li>
<li>define an incremental approach to benefits delivery</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>EA engagement is likely to be front loaded focused on defining
current state, target state and the roadmap followed by a supporting
role to help maintain the overall integrity of the approach as the
business and technology changes progress</p>
</div>
<div id="wicked-problems" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Wicked Problems</h1>
<ul>
<li>are poorly understood, are ambiguous</li>
<li>have a constantly changing problem space with complex
interdependencies</li>
<li>often have significant social / people / political complexity​</li>
<li>large parts of the currrent and / or target state cannot be defined
with confidence</li>
<li>Enterprise Architects can help
<ul>
<li>make sense of the complexity</li>
<li>identify areas of uncertainty</li>
<li>define experiments and nudges to enable learning</li>
<li>define an incremental approach to benefits delivery</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>EA engagement is likely to be continual during the programme which
will be based on an agiler learning approach</p>

<li>Invitation</li>
<li>Workshop roles</li>
<li>Ground rules</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="precondition" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Precondition</h1>
<p>A concern of potentially enterprise wide significance has been
identified by an EA​</p>
<p>e.g.​</p>
<ul>
<li>A formal request for architecure work is made</li>
<li>A senior stakeholder says “take a look at this…”​</li>
<li>An EA gets an idea at a conference​</li>
<li>An EA hears a worrying statement about…​
<ul>
<li>a project​</li>
<li>technical debt​</li>
<li>lack of collaboration​</li>
<li>siloes​</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An experienced EA just gets a sense that something is wrong!​</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="workshop-formats" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Workshop formats</h1>
<p>There are three formats that we use</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Informal with EAs only​ (these can be quite quick)</p></li>
<li><p>More formal with key stakeholders and EAs​</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple stakeholder meetings followed by a joint
playback​</p></li>
<li><p>the workshop may be held as one intensive session or a series of
shorter sessions over several days</p></li>
<li><p>the facilitator should consider giving the participants breaks
after each section</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="attendees" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Attendees</h1>
<p>You can combine formats if it helps​</p>
<ul>
<li>You want a rehearsal with EAs only​</li>
<li>You want to make sense of what the stakeholders said (e.g. create
the stakeholder playback)​</li>
</ul>
<p>5 to 8 people is an ideal size for the meeting​</p>
<p>Give attendees plenty of notice of the meeting</p>
<p>Meetings can be fully remote​</p>
</div>
<div id="the-invitation" class="slide section level1">
<h1>The Invitation</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hi AP</em></p>
<p><em>As I am sure you are aware we have major challenges with [brief
description of the challenge].</em></p>
<p><em>We are running a workshop to develop a strong problem statement
and work out how to kick off an initiative to improve the
situation.</em> <em>You will see an invitation to a video call in your
inbox soon.</em></p>
<p><em>I am looking forward to your valuable contribution.</em></p>
<p><em>Best wishes</em></p>
<p><em>JJ - Head of Enterprise Architecture</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="roles" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Roles</h1>
<p>The workshop will require these roles to be successful -</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitator - takes the attendees through the workshop structure,
adapting it as necessary, owns the schedule</li>
<li>Challenge owner - presents the challenge, makes decisions when asked
to do so by the Facilitator, maybe a proxy for a key stakeholder</li>
<li>Scribe - makes notes when asked to do so by the facilitator</li>
<li>Timekeeper - keeps time when asked to do so by the facilitator</li>
<li>Experts - the Facilitator should think about what knowledge is
necessary to conclude the workshop successfully. Do “experts” need to be
presnt for some or all sessions? Can they be engaged in advance and
provide workshop materials for use ion the sessions or as pre-read
materials?</li>
</ul>

<div id="ground-rules" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Ground rules</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>However, don’t worry about children, pets, partners, deliveries,
builders, etc
<ul>
<li>they will interrupt and distract, it is OK!</li>
<li>this is normal!</li>
<li>sometimes they help with the creativity…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you need a break, just say so</li>

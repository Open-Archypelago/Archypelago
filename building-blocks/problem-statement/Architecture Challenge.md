# Introduction
Before we start on any architecture work we need to know what business problem aim to solve​

At the end of this workshop, we should have​:

- Identified the problem​
- Gained an understanding what successful resolution looks like​
- Identified the key stakeholders who must commit to delivering success​
- Determined if there is potential enterprise architecture to do​

For enterprise architects (EAs) to add value the problem should be a mess or wicked or both:​

- Messy – has high process, data or technology complexity​
- Wicked – poorly understood, constantly changing problem with complex interdependencies, often social / people complexity​

# Precondition
A concern of potentially enterprise wide significance has been identified by an EA​

e.g.​

- A senior stakeholder says "take a look at this..."​
- An EA gets an idea at a conference​
- An EA hears a worrying statement in a meeting about...​
  - Project​
  - Technical debt​
  - Lack of collaboration​
  - Siloes​
- An experienced EA just gets a sense that something is wrong!​

---
# Attendees
There are three formats for this:​
- Informal with EAs only​
- More formal with key stakeholders and EAs​
- Multiple stakeholder meetings followed by a joint playback​

You can combine formats if it helps​
- You want a rehearsal with EAs only​
- You want to make sense of what the stakeholders said (e.g. create the stakeholder playback)​

5 to 8 people is an ideal size for the meeting​

Give attendees plenty of notice of the meeting+

Meetings can be fully remote​

# Roles
The workshop will require these roles to be successful:

- Facilitator: takes the attendees through the workshop structure, adapting it as necessary, owns the schedule
- Challenge owner: presents the challenge, makes decisions when asked to do so by the Facilitator, maybe a proxy for a key stakeholder
- Scribe: makes notes when asked to do so by the facilitator
- Timekeeper: keeps time when asked to do so by the facilitator

# Ground rules
1. The Facilitator is in charge
2. Challenge owner makes decisions
3. No distractions from phones or emails or chat

    - switch off notifications
    - we will have breaks
  
1. Don't worry about children, pets, partners, deliveries, builders, etc

    - they will interrupt and distract, it is OK!
    - this is normal!
    - sometimes they help with the creativity...

# Problem
### Purpose: create a description of the business problem
### Duration: 1 hour

1. Ask the participants to write down 2-3 bullet points that describe their perspective on the challenge
   
    - Write the notes individually without discussion and without showing them
    - What is the root cause?
    - Why is it important to address the challenge?

1. All participants show their notes at the same time
2. The facilitator talks through each note in turn
3. The facilitator creates a summary note that captures the agreement and divergence of the team's contributions
4. The facilitator asks for any further thoughts from the team and adds to the summary if necessary
5. The facilitator then leads an analysis of the summary to firm up the problem description and resolve any disagreements. The following questions can be used as a start point:

    - How does this damage the business?​
    - Will key business stakeholders recognise the problem?
    - What makes it **significant**​ to the business stakeholders?
    - What makes it important to do something now?​
    - What value will enterprise architects bring to the challenge?

1. The facilitator summarises the discussion under the following headings:

    - Problem statement highlighting the negative impact on the business
    - Who is impacted negatively by the problem?
    - Who benefits from the problem?
    - Why is is important now?
    - What important things don't we know?
    - How can enterprise architects help?

Now it's time to take a short break!

# Success
### Purpose: create an ambitious description of what it will like when we have solved the problem
### Duration: 45 minutes

1. Ask the participants to write down 2-3 bullet points that describe what is will be like when the problem has been **fully** solved
   
    - Write the notes individually without discussion and without showing them
    - This should be idealistic, not realistic or pragmatic (we will add that later)

1. All participants show their notes at the same time
2. The facilitator talks through each note in turn
3. The facilitator creates a summary note that captures the agreement and divergence of the team's contributions
4. The facilitator asks for any further thoughts from the team and adds to the summary if necessary
5. The facilitator then leads an analysis of the summary to firm up what an idealistic and ambitious view of success looks like and resolve any disagreements.
6. The next step is to make this **realistic**. The following questions can be used as a start point:

    - What is the maximum that should be paid to solve this problem​?
    - What are the major steps required to deliver the ideal​?
    - Can these be delivered?
    - Can the ideal be delivered in phases?
    - Is there a point before we get to the ideal that is "good enough"?
    - What are the big risks, issues, blockers, concerns, constraints​ that may stop us achieving the ideal?
    - Are any critical details that could derail us​
    - Is it still **significant** and **ambitious**?​

6. Now we want ot mnake it **measureable** and **time-bound**. The following questions can be used to help:
    
    - How do we measure it​?
    - When must success be delivered​?
    - Is it still **realistic**, **significant** and **ambitious**?​

1. We now have a view of success, a target state that is

    **S**ignificant  
    **M**easureable  
    **A**mbitious  
    **R**ealistic  
    **T**imebound  

Now it's time to take another short break!

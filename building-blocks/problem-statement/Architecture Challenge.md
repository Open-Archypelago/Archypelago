# Introduction
Before we start on any architecture work we need to know what business problem aim to solve​

At the end of this workshop, we should have​:

- Identified the problem​
- Gained an understanding what successful resolution looks like​
- Identified the key stakeholders who must commit to delivering success​
- Determined if there is potential enterprise architecture to do​

For enterprise architects (EAs) to add value the problem should be a mess or wicked or both:​

- Messy – has high process, data or technology complexity​
- Wicked – poorly understood, constantly changing problem with complex interdependencies, often social / people complexity​

# Precondition
A concern of potentially enterprise wide significance has been identified by an EA​

e.g.​

- A senior stakeholder says "take a look at this..."​
- An EA gets an idea at a conference​
- An EA hears a worrying statement in a meeting about...​
  - Project​
  - Technical debt​
  - Lack of collaboration​
  - Siloes​
- An experienced EA just gets a sense that something is wrong!​

---
# Attendees
There are three formats for this:​
- Informal with EAs only​
- More formal with key stakeholders and EAs​
- Multiple stakeholder meetings followed by a joint playback​

You can combine formats if it helps​
- You want as rehearsal with EAs only​
- You want to make sense of what the stakeholders said (e.g. create the stakeholder playback)​

5 to 8 people is an ideal size for the meeting​

Meetings can be fully remote​

# The Invitation

# Introduction

# Problem
1. Ask the participants to write down 2-3 bullet points that describe their perspective on the challenge
   
    - Write the notes individually without discussion and without showing them
    - What is the root cause?
    - Why is it important to address the challenge?

1. All participants show their notes at the same time
2. The facilitator talks through each note in turn
3. The facilitator creates a summary note that captures the agreement and divergence of the team's contributions
4. The facilitator asks for any further thoughts from the team and adds to the summary if necessary
5. The facilitator then leads an analysis of the summary to firm up the problem description and resolve any disagreements. The following questions can be used as a start point:

    - How does this damage the business?​
    - Will key business stakeholders recognise the problem?
    - What makes it important​ to the business stakeholders?
    - What makes it important to do something now?​
    - What value will enterprise architects bring to the challenge?

1. The facilitator summarises the discussion under the following headings:

    - Problem statement highlighting the negative impact on the business
    - Who is impacted negatively by the problem?
    - Who benefits from the problem?
    - Why is is important now?

# Introduction
Before we start on any architecture work we need to know what business problem aim to solve​

At the end of this workshop, we should have​:

- Identified the problem​
- Gained an understanding what successful resolution looks like​
- Identified the key stakeholders who must commit to delivering success​
- Determined if there is potential enterprise architecture to do​

For enterprise architects (EAs) to add value the problem should be a mess or wicked or both:​

- Messy – has high process, data or technology complexity​
- Wicked – poorly understood, constantly changing problem with complex interdependencies, often social / people complexity​

# Precondition
A concern of potentially enterprise wide significance has been identified by an EA​

e.g.​

- A senior stakeholder says "take a look at this..."​
- An EA gets an idea at a conference​
- An EA hears a worrying statement in a meeting about...​
  - Project​
  - Technical debt​
  - Lack of collaboration​
  - Siloes​
- An experienced EA just gets a sense that something is wrong!​

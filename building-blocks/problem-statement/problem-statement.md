# Problem / Opportunity Identification

1. Ask the workshop participants to write down 2-3 bullet points that describe their perspective on the challenge

    - Write the notes individually without discussion and without showing them
    - Ater a few minutes provide guidance to help generate a few more thoughts
        - What is the source of the opportunity or root cause of the problem?
        - Why is it important to address the challenge?
        - Do not think about solutions

1. All participants show their notes at the same time
1. The facilitator talks through each note in turn
3. The scribe creates a summary note that captures the agreement and divergence of the team's contributions
4. The facilitator asks for any further thoughts from the team and the scribe updates the summary if necessary

- How does this damage or benefit the business?​
- Will key business stakeholders recognise the problem / opportunity?
- What makes it **significant**​ to the business stakeholders?
- What makes it **important** to do something **now**?​

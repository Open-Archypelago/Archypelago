  - what is the maximum that should be paid to solve this problem
  - what does success look like
  - how do we measure it
  - when must success be delivered
  - can it success be phased
  - can we stop before we get to success
  - risks, issues, blockers, concerns, constraints
  - any critical details that could derail us
- key stakeholders
  - who pays
  - who cares
  - who can cause problems
  - who needs to support
  - who do we need to persuade to back us
- decisions
  - go / no go - should we look for solutions?

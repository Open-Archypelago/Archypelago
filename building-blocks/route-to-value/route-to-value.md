# Route to Value Identification

1. Ask the participants to write down about 10 bullet points that describe how success can be delivered

    - Write the notes individually without discussion and without showing them
    - If you have any solution options, list them now, we are capturing them to show that there are possible ways forward (we will not discuss them in detail in this workshop)
    - This should be idealistic, not realistic or pragmatic (we will add that later)

1. All participants show their notes at the same time
2. The facilitator talks through each note in turn
3. The facilitator creates a summary note that captures the agreement and divergence of the team's contributions
4. The facilitator asks for any further thoughts from the team and adds to the summary if necessary
1. The facilitator then leads an analysis of the summary to firm up the route to value and resolve any disagreements.

# Route to Value Analysis

1. The next step is to adjust our route to make sure that we are being **realistic**. The following questions can be used as a start point

    - What is the maximum cost and time to solve this problem​?
    - What are the major steps required to deliver the ideal​?
    - Can these be delivered?
    - Can the benefits be delivered in phases?
    - Is there a point before we get to the ideal that is "good enough"?
    - What are the risks, issues, blockers, concerns, constraints​ or critical details that may stop us achieving the ideal?

1. We now have a **realistic** route to value

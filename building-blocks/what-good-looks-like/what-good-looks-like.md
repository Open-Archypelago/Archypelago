# Success Description

1. Ask the participants to write down 2-3 bullet points that describe what is will be like when the problem has been **fully** solved

    - Write the notes individually without discussion and without showing them
    - This should be idealistic, not realistic or pragmatic (we will add that later)
    - Do not think about solutions

1. All participants show their notes at the same time
2. The facilitator talks through each note in turn
3. The facilitator creates a summary note that captures the agreement and divergence of the team's contributions
4. The facilitator asks for any further thoughts from the team and adds to the summary if necessary

# Success Analysis

1. The facilitator then leads an analysis of the summary to firm up what an **ambitious** view of success looks like and resolve any disagreements.
1. The next step is to make sure that we know when we have achieved success, is it **measureable**? The following questions can be used as a start point -

    - What objective measures can we use to confirm that we have achieved success?
    - What measures can we use to help us understand that we are on track to deliver success
    - How does this change our definition of success?
    - Is it **significant** and **ambitious**?â€‹

1. We now have a view of success, a target state that is

    **M**easureable
    **A**mbitious
